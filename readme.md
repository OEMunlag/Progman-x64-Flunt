# Program Manager, 64-bit
![Progman Logo](/website/images/pmlogo.png)

Program Manager was the default shell from Windows 3.0 to Windows for Workgroups 3.11 in the DOS era, and from NT 3.1 to NT 3.51 in the NT era.

This project takes the copy of it found from OpenNT to modernize and make it a viable shell again in the current year.
