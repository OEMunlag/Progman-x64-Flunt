# Program Manager, 64-bit
![Progman Logo](/misc/pmlogo.png)

Program Manager was the default shell from Windows 3.0 to Windows for Workgroups 3.11 in the DOS era, and from NT 3.1 to NT 3.51 in the NT era.

This project takes the copy of it found from OpenNT to modernize and make it a viable shell again in the current year.

Please create issues for feature suggestions and help. I am open to any suggestions and am very open to any help taking this project on.

Pull requests are also extremely useful, so if you have the capacity to code and improve Progman, I encourage you to contribute.

I will be publishing a roadmap in the future, for all planned and wanted features for Progman.
